#Interactive Graphics Homework Repository
##Requirements
There are 4 files:

1. *basic-objects.js*: contains the definition of the primitives used in the example
2. *gl-matrix.js* contains the utility functions on matrices and vectors
3. *HW.html* Main File
4. *simple-rotator.js* contains the code for the rotator

You only need to modify the HW.html file. You need to complete/modify the file with the code needed to:

1. ~~Create a fully assembled bicycle~~
2. ~~Create a tree~~
3. ~~Create a scene with two bicycles and 4 trees~~
4. Modify the vertex and fragment shaders to implement Phong shading with 1 directional light (moving so to simulate the sun) and 2 positional lights positioned on the front of the bicycles
5. (optional) Add textures on the objects (trees, disc, etcâ€¦)
